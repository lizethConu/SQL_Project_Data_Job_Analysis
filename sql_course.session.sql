Problem Statement
Count the number of unique companies that offer 
work from home (WFH) versus those requiring work 
to be on-site. Use the job_postings_fact table to 
count and compare the distinct companies based on 
their WFH policy (job_work_from_home).

Hint
Use COUNT with DISTINCT to ensure each company is only counted once, even if they have multiple job postings.
Use CASE WHEN to separate companies based on their WFH policy (job_work_from_home column).
